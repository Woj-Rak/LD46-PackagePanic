# Package Panic: Always On Time
This is a game I created in 72 hours as a submission for the 46th Ludum Dare game jam. \

# Concept
Keep your town and your neighbours ALIVE by being the best delivery man the world has ever seen. The town you live has been struck by a streak of bad luck and there doesn't seem to be an end in sight. Every day another accident occurs on the streets of this once quiet town. Your neighbours no longer want to leave their homes and are now depending on YOU to deliver them everything they need.
